# EncrypProgram

This program encryptes a word/phrase in one of two ways: either using a caesers cipher or a vigenere cipher. 

Current Errors: 
Vigenere Cipher Encoding and Decoding is currently not functional, and the decoding part may never be functional (due to it requiring NLP to be accurate.) As for the encoding, please send me a message if you want to see the code for the encoding parts, as it is hidden somewhere in a heap of XCode files and finding it will be an undertaking.
